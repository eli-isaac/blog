## A quick glimpse

This is placeholder content meant to show how the preview, modal, and full-page flows look with multiple items. It keeps the text short so the focus stays on the UI polish.

## Sample details

- Smooth transitions make the experience feel intentional
- Light backgrounds on hover should feel subtle
- The modal should stay above the rest without hiding it

That is all for now — just enough text to check wrapping and spacing.
