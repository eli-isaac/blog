## Notes

More filler copy to validate how multiple posts stack, hover, and expand. The goal is to keep the layout stable while you interact with each preview.

### Bullets for variety

- Cards should keep their positions
- Icons only appear on hover
- The modal lifts without dimming the page

With this, we have enough material to judge spacing and animations.
