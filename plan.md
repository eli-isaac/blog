@src/components/Posts.jsx 
we need a wrapper around postheader, we dont want to display a list of raw post headers since we want to do a bit more here, we need a post preview component
i want that when u hover over any of these posts u get a faint background with rounded borders and also a button on the right showing an expand icon, when u click on the expand icon, the post preview box grows into a proper modal that is cented on the screen on top of everything else, but this transformation needs to be smooth and the positions of other stuff on the page should not be changed, so we need to be smart about thisim thinking we have have list placeholders that always stay in their place, then we have the post preview elemtnst on top of them, when u click on the expand button the post preview button has an animated transition to its "modal stage", btw in the modal stage we should stil have the post header component on top, but should also show the the article content too in the modal, we should actually just be display the proper mdx post component inside the modal, and we should have a nother expand icon that will smothly transition from there to the regular post page using famraer mothion for the whole mdx component so its a smooth transition, and we need a button from there to go to the article
also when the user goes from the preview to the article page itself that needs to happen smoothly
we need to do this all smart and clean as possible, i cant have my code becoming a mess
